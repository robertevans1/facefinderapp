A project that demonstates how make use of image processing algorithms in c++ or python from a Flutter app.

Image processing applications are often built using languages like c++, as those allow fast, precise analysis and manipulation of the image pixels. It's handy to be able to make use of these from a flutter app as then we can access those powerful image processing ability from an cross platform app.
